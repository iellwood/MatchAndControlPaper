### Ian T. Ellwood, Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, Cornell University

This repository contains the code to implement the model described in the paper. All code is dependent on the NEURON
simulator https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/, which must be installed so that your python interpreter can access its
libraries through `import neuron`.
